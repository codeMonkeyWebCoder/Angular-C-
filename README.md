# Event App - Angular / C# .Net Core Project

***project under development***

A WEB APP Project using Angular and .NET tenologies. In order to keep learning more about the enviroment and how the server-side comunicate with the client-side I did a step forward to get this two guys talking together. I'm curious to see how JWT link the comunication between the front-end and back-end.

To build this App and Web Api solution I used Entity Framework with Migration to interact with SQL Express Database. I am also implementing JWT to create a register/login for this App. 



## Technologies used

* [ASP.NET CORE REST API](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/apis).

* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/about/). 
* [JWT](https://jwt.io/). 

```bash
